title: Katas
---

Coding Katas are a way of practicing muscle memory and approaching a simple problem in the simplest way possible. I     have not attempted too many katas so far, but intend to do as many as I can going forwards. Two that I have approached are the roman numerals kata and the coin changer kata. The more you practice them the easier they become.

I am going to attempt to at least start one every morning. [This](http://exercism.io/) is a great website that has a long list of different katas in different languages and the well-known [CodeWars] (http://www.codewars.com/about) is another that is fun and easy to  use.
