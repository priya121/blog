title : Arrays in Java
___

Arrays in Ruby are incredibly useful and most of the tasks and programs that I built while I was learning Ruby had some an array within it at some point or another. As I learn more Java, Iâ€™m sure that arrays will be increasingly useful, and I have already used some briefly in some of the katas that I am practicing.

Arrays in Java must be created using an array creation expression. 

e.g.     new type[length] 

The type must be explicitly set as is everything must be in Java. Similar to Ruby different elements can be accessed using array[i] where i is the index number of the element trying to be accessed.

It is also possible to create multi-dimensional arrays by writing type [] [], type [] [] [] etc.

There are also no array constants, new arrays are created every time an array initialiser is evaluated. 

Despite there being these restrictions on arrays in Java, by using class Arrays in java.util certain utility methods are available that allow you manipulate the indices within an array.
