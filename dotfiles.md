title: Dotfiles
-----

Setting up a new machine can take time abd it is always nice to take your time customizing the settings just how you like them. But this can take a long time if there are many settings you have to set manually. A useful way to speed up this process and cut down duplication time is to copy across your dotfiles from git.

I recently did this and now am able to quickly work on my projects on the new machine just as I did before. In order to clone across the files, it is also necessary to set up your new machine with an SSH key on git. There are many resources that help with this. One I used is: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/] and it is a simple process.

Now I can manage my settings across multiple devices and am more comfortable with adding to my dotfiles. Next step is to change my vim colours!
