title: Encapsulation in Ruby 
---
There are many useful components in Ruby as a language and one I looked into closer recently is Encapsulation.

Encapsulation reduces coupling as it hides the internal representation or data structure of a particular object. This makes it easier to make changes when they become necessary, as if there are changes that need to be made to the data within the class, it will handle these changes and they will not have to be made throughout the entire program or application. 

Encapsulation makes more sense when programs get larger, but I am going to try and implement it as soon as possible and this will make things easier to change.
