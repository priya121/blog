Object Oriented Design (OOD) is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot in software design and it is easy to think of it as an extra addition to add to code if you have the  luxury of time. But actually good OOD saves a lot of pain if ever you need to change a program later on in time.
 
  One of the main components of good OO design is the correct flow of dependencies. A dependency is when one class requires another to work or uses another class in order to work (the first class is said to depend on the second).  A UML diagram often helps to figure out what the correct flow of dependencies should be. If you can control the flow of dependencies and recognise which direction the flow should be directed you have the basis of understanding good Object Oriented Design.
